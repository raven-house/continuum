# NFT Contract

The `NFT` contract implements an ERC-721-like non-fungible token with Aztec-specific privacy extensions. It supports transfers and interactions through both private and public ownership, offering full coverage of Aztec's confidentiality features for unique digital assets.

This contract provides a comprehensive NFT implementation that allows seamless transitions between private and public ownership states, making it ideal for applications requiring flexible privacy controls.

## Transfer Events

The contract emits a public `Transfer { from, to, token_id }` event on every ownership-changing operation (mints, burns, public transfers, and cross-domain private ↔ public moves), enabling indexers to track NFT movements.

| Operation | Event Pattern |
|-----------|---------------|
| Mint to public | `Transfer(0x0, recipient, tokenId)` |
| Mint to private | `Transfer(0x0, PRIVATE_ADDRESS, tokenId)` |
| Burn from public | `Transfer(from, 0x0, tokenId)` |
| Burn from private | `Transfer(PRIVATE_ADDRESS, 0x0, tokenId)` |
| Public-to-public | `Transfer(from, to, tokenId)` |
| Public-to-private | `Transfer(from, PRIVATE_ADDRESS, tokenId)` |
| Private-to-public | `Transfer(PRIVATE_ADDRESS, to, tokenId)` |
| Public-to-commitment | `Transfer(from, PRIVATE_ADDRESS, tokenId)` |
| Private-to-private | _(no public events)_ |
| Private-to-commitment | _(no public events)_ |

**Sentinel values:** `0x0` denotes mint origin (`from`) or burn destination (`to`), following ERC-721. `PRIVATE_ADDRESS` (sha224 of `"PRIVATE_ADDRESS"`) denotes the private side of an ownership change when the counterpart cannot be revealed.

## Storage Fields

- `name: FieldCompressedString`: NFT collection name (compressed).
- `symbol: FieldCompressedString`: NFT collection symbol (compressed).
- `private_nfts: Map<AztecAddress, PrivateSet<NFTNote>>`: Private NFT ownership per account.
- `nft_exists: Map<Field, bool>`: Mapping from token ID to existence status.
- `public_owners: Map<Field, AztecAddress>`: Public ownership mapping from token ID to owner address.
- `minter: AztecAddress`: Authorized minter address.
